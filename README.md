My project for module 3 at Flatiron is a single page application (SPA) using a Ruby on Rails backend API. The frontend was designed using vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
This project integrates everything I learned in module 3 including the ability to: 

 * Design and architect features across frontend and backend
 * Communicate and collaborate in a technical environment
 * Build and iterate on a project MVP
 * Debug issues in small- to medium-sized projects
 * Integrate JavaScript and Rails



Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
